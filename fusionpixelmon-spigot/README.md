Add a little extra to your Pixelmon experience - PokeBuilder, ArcPlates, Modifier Tokens, and more!

## Download
You can download the latest version from [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/fusionpixelmon.84753/).

## Install
Add the plugin to the `/plugins` folder of your modded Spigot server.

## Dependencies
Also refer to the [General Dependencies](../README.md#dependencies).
- [Spigot](https://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.12.2.html)

## Config
The config files can be found in `<server>/plugins/FusionPixelmon`.

To modify features of this plugin, open `fusionpixelmon.conf`, and start the server after saving any changes made.

Above each setting in the config file, there will be comments explaining the feature and how to disable it.

To return the `fusionpixelmon.conf` config file back to the original, you can either delete it and it'll be created upon next server startup, or copy-paste the values from the [default config](https://github.com/BrendonCurmi/FusionPixelmon/blob/master/fusionpixelmon-core/src/main/resources/assets/fusionpixelmon/default.conf).

## Features
### PokeDesigner
An interactive PokeDesigner with 12 shops for modifying your Pokemon.

Inspired by the pokemon designer on PokeCentral.org

### Shrine Pickup
Allows the "breaking" and picking up of Pixelmon's unbreakable Shrines, Timespace Altars, and Chalices.
Clicking one of these structures in survival mode while holding the appropriate diamond tool will drop this item in your inventory, if there are available slots.
In the multiplayer versions, shrines can also be locked to prevent other players from picking them up.

### Modifier Tokens
Token items which can be used to modify specific aspects of your Pokemon.
Admins could add modifier tokens to chest loot or prizes for players, if original item data is preserved.
